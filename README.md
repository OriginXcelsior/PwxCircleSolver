# PwxCircleSolver

How to use:
Run circle1.py and circle2.py to generate the combinations you need

You will need to change the values of x,y and z to match the circles information inside circle1.py and circle2.py.

z is the limit which is the value of the missing value you want to find. (as in we are assuming that the other two numbers create it)


ENJOY!!
