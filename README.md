# PwxCircleSolver

How to use:
Run circle1.py and circle2.py to create the combinations you want

You will need to change the values of x,y and z to match the circles information.

z is the limit which is the value of the missing value you want to find. (as in we are assuming that the other two numbers create it)

when you have ran circle1.py and circle2.py run combine.py this will create 2 CSV files for you then you can
put the 2 csv files into excel and use vlookup function. the matches from circle1.py and circle2.py are the formulas 
that will solve your problem.

ENJOY!!
